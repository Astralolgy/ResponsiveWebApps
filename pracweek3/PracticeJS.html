    <h2>Practicing Javascript</h2>

    <p>I'll be playing with various string methods available in the JS library! </p>
    
    <p id ="webIntro"></p>

    <button onclick="myFirstButton()">Funky button one</button>
    <p id="transformingFruit">By pressing button one, magically, Strawberries will change into another fruit!</p>

    <button onclick="mySecondButton()">Cool button two</button>
    <p id="vanishingFruit">But if you press button two, no strawberries, watermelons, or bananas will remain, only chocolate.</p>

    <script>
        let webIntro = 
        "Hello! Rather than having to rewrite this text several times over" + 
        " I can simply write it into a variable and then when it needs to change, I can just change the variables content!";
        document.getElementById("webIntro").innerHTML = webIntro;
    </script>

    <script>
    function myFirstButton() 
    {
        let magicFruit = document.getElementById("transformingFruit").innerHTML; 
        document.getElementById("transformingFruit").innerHTML =
        fixList = magicFruit.replace("Strawberries", "Blueberries");
    }
    </script>

    <script>
    function mySecondButton()
    {
        let vanish = document.getElementById("vanishingFruit").innerHTML;
        document.getElementById("vanishingFruit").innerHTML =
        onlyChoc = vanish.slice(83);
    }
    </script>

    <p>We can also use some basic methods to numbers as well using Javascript and printing them too.</p>
    <p id ="Convert"></p>
    <p>
        Just like that, without manually writing the number I can print any number I want as long as I change a small value, simplifying the process.
        The first number was returned as a string and can be treated like one, while the second was returned as a number, and can be handled like such.
        Visually there's no difference but behind the scenes this can mean a lot! 
    </p>

    <p id ="Parsing"></p>
    <p>
        A cool trick is to also return numbers given in a string variable, because if we write 70 between " " then thats a string, so we can instead
        parse that value to return our desired number...
        However! It'll only parse it using the parseFloat method if a number is at the very start! That's why it returns NaN at the end.
        NaN = Not a Number
    </p>

    <p id="TheArrays">
        We can also use arrays, and their related to methods to return lists of values of strings or integers.
        While the name Amanda exists at the end, looking behind the front page shows it was added in to replace the name Katie!
    </p>

    <script>
        let num = 782;
        document.getElementById("Convert").innerHTML = 
        num.toString();
        num.valueOf();
    </script>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("Parsing").innerHTML = 
        parseFloat("51") + "<br>" +
        parseFloat("78 34") + "<br>" +
        parseFloat("She's 27 years old");
    </script>

    <script>
        const names = ["Kira", "Milly", "Grace", "Katie"];
        document.getElementById("TheArrays").innerHTML = names.pop();
        document.getElementById("TheArrays").innerHTML = names.push("Amanda");
        document.getElementById("TheArrays").innerHTML = names.join(", ");
    </script>

    <p>Finally, Javascript is versatile and can be used to implement various methods using dates and time</p>
    <p>The order of a date object goes: Year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond:</p>
    <p id="exDate">
        Less numbers can be used to get the same effect without the precision, just using 3 will result in year, month date, and so on.
    </p>

    <p id="utcDate"></p>
    <p>Above this is the date it currently is, in universal time!</p>

    <p id="theVerySecond"></p>
    <p>Above this, is the EXACT second which you opened this website!</p>
    
    <script>
        const date = new Date(2002, 08, 15, 13, 54, 11, 3);
        const dated = new Date();
        document.getElementById("exDate").innerHTML = date;
        document.getElementById("utcDate").innerHTML = dated.getUTCDate();
        document.getElementById("theVerySecond").innerHTML = dated.getSeconds();
    </script>
