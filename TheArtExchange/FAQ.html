        <p>Q. What's the purpose of this website? <br> 
            A. This website was created with the intention of demonstrating my ability
            to implement various elements used to design a website</p>
        <p>Q. Will it ever turn into a genuine buisness idea? <br>
            A. It's quite possible, I have a passion for suppoting artists and frequently support
            their work and do my best to provide advice from an outside <br>perspective, at the time of
            creating this website however I lack the skills to do this. (09/22)</p>
        <p>Q. How would you like to improve this website? <br>
            A. It's no secret I lack the visual eye that a graphic designer does which could provide this
            website a more visually appealing display, so I'd first like to <br>improve that, then focus on quality
            of life features</p>
        <p>Q. Cool website, do you have any others? <br>
            A. Thanks, it's my goal to include this along with future endevours in a portfolio designed in the
            form of a website, when I do that, I'll include the link <br>here: </p>
